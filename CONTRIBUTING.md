## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate of others.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cova.git
   cd cova
   ```
3. Set up the development environment:

   # Install Rust (if not already installed)
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
   # Install development tools
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b type/area/description
   # Example: git checkout -b feat/algebra/vector-spaces
   ```

2. Make your changes following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines

3. Run tests and checks:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   ```

4. Commit your changes following the [Commit Message Format](#commit-message-format)

5. Push your branch and create a Pull Request

## Documentation

Harness provides two types of documentation that you should be familiar with:

### API Documentation
The Rust API documentation for all crates can be viewed using:
```bash
just docs
```
This will build and open the Rust API documentation in your browser. This documentation is automatically generated from your code comments and should be kept up to date.

### Book Documentation
The comprehensive book documentation can be viewed using:
```bash
just book
```
This will serve the book documentation locally and open it in your browser. The book includes detailed explanations of mathematical concepts, examples, and usage guides.

When contributing, please:
1. Keep API documentation up to date with your code changes
2. Update the book documentation if you add new features or change existing behavior
3. Add examples to both API docs and the book where appropriate
4. Ensure mathematical definitions and references are accurate

## Issue Guidelines

When creating issues, please use the provided templates and follow these guidelines:

### Title Format
```
type(area): brief description
```
Where:
- `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- `area` is one of: `algebra`, `space`

### Labels
Please use appropriate labels to categorize your issue:
- Area labels: `area: algebra`, `area: space`
- Priority labels: `priority: critical/high/medium/low`
- Type labels: `type: enhancement`, `type: refactor`
- Technical labels: `tech: performance`, `tech: security`, `tech: testing`

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Use the provided PR template
2. Ensure your PR title follows the format: `type(area): description`
3. Link related issues using `closes #issue_number`
4. Keep PRs focused and small when possible
5. Include tests for new features or bug fixes
6. Update documentation as needed

## Code Style

- Follow Rust's official style guide
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include examples in documentation
- Run all tests before submitting PRs
- Consider edge cases and error conditions

## Commit Message Format

Follow this format for commit messages:
```

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Where:
- `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
